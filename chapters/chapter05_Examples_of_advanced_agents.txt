Examples of advanced agents
Google Co-Scientist
Co-Scientist is an advanced AI agent designed to function as a virtual research collaborator, 
accelerating scientific discovery by systematically exploring complex problem spaces. It 
enables researchers to define a goal, ground the agent in specified public and proprietary 
knowledge sources, and then generate and evaluate a landscape of novel hypotheses.
In order to be able to achieve this, Co-Scientist spawns a whole ecosystem of agents 
collaborating with each other.

Think of the system as a research project manager. The AI first takes a broad research 
goal and creates a detailed project plan. A "Supervisor" agent then acts as the manager, 
delegating tasks to a team of specialized agents and distributing resources like computing 
power. This structure ensures the project can easily scale up and that the team's methods 
improve as they work toward the final goal.

The various agents work for hours, or even days, and keep improving the generated 
hypotheses, running loops and meta loops that improve not only the generated ideas, but 
also the way that we judge and create new ideas.

AlphaEvolve Agent
Another example of an advanced agentis system is AlphaEvolve, an AI agent that discovers 
and optimizes algorithms for complex problems in mathematics and computer science.
AlphaEvolve works by combining the creative code generation of our Gemini language 
models with an automated evaluation system. It uses an evolutionary process: the AI 
generates potential solutions, an evaluator scores them, and the most promising ideas are 
used as inspiration for the next generation of code.
This approach has already led to significant breakthroughs, including:
•	 Improving the efficiency of Google's data centers, chip design, and AI training.
•	 Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms.
•	 Finding new solutions to open mathematical problems.
AlphaEvolve excels at problems where verifying the quality of a solution is far easier than 
finding it in the first place.

AlphaEvolve is designed for a deep, iterative partnership between humans and AI. This 
collaboration works in two main ways:
•	 Transparent Solutions: The AI generates solutions as human-readable code. This 
transparency allows users to understand the logic, gain insights, trust the results, and 
directly modify the code for their needs.
•	 Expert Guidance: Human expertise is essential for defining the problem. Users guide the 
AI by refining evaluation metrics and steering the exploration, which prevents the system 
from exploiting unintended loopholes in the problem's definition. This interactive loop 
ensures the final solutions are both powerful and practical.
The result of the agent is a continuous improvement of the code that keeps improving the 
metrics specified by the human.
