From Predictive AI to 
Autonomous Agents
Artificial intelligence is changing. For years, the focus has been on models that excel at 
passive, discrete tasks: answering a question, translating text, or generating an image from 
a prompt. This paradigm, while powerful, requires constant human direction for every step. 
We're now seeing a paradigm shift, moving from AI that just predicts or creates content to a 
new class of software capable of autonomous problem-solving and task execution.
This new frontier is built around AI agents. An agent is not simply an AI model in a static 
workflow; it's a complete application, making plans and taking actions to achieve goals. It 
combines a Language Model's (LM) ability to reason with the practical ability to act, allowing 
Agents are the natural evolution 
of Language Models, made useful 
in software.

it to handle complex, multi-step tasks that a model alone cannot. The critical capability is that 
agents can work on their own, figuring out the next steps needed to reach a goal without a 
person guiding them at every turn.
This document is the first in a five-part series, acting as a formal guide for the developers, 
architects, and product leaders transitioning from proofs-of-concept to robust, 
production-grade agentic systems. While building a simple prototype is straightforward, 
ensuring security, quality and reliability is a significant challenge. This paper provides a 
comprehensive foundation:
•	 Core Anatomy: Deconstructing an agent into its three essential components: the 
reasoning Model, actionable Tools, and the governing Orchestration Layer.
•	 A Taxonomy of Capabilities: Classifying agents from simple, connected problem-solvers 
to complex, collaborative multi-agent systems.
•	 Architectural Design: Diving into the practical design considerations for each 
component, from model selection to tool implementation.
•	 Building for Production: Establishing the Agent Ops discipline needed to evaluate, 
debug, secure, and scale agentic systems from a single instance to a fleet with 
enterprise governance.
Building on the previous Agents whitepaper1 and Agent Companion2; this guide provides 
the foundational concepts and strategic frameworks you will need to successfully build, 
deploy, and manage this new generation of intelligent applications which can reason, act and 
observe to accomplish goals3.
