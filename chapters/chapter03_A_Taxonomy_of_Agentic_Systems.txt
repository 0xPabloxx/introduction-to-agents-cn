A Taxonomy of Agentic Systems
Understanding the 5-step operational loop is the first part of the puzzle. The second is 
recognizing that this loop can be scaled in complexity to create different classes of agents. 
For an architect or product leader, a key initial decision is scoping what kind of agent to build.
We can classify agentic systems into a few broad levels, each building on the capabilities of 
the last.

Level 0: The Core Reasoning System
Before we can have an agent, we must start with the "Brain" in its most basic form: the 
reasoning engine itself. In this configuration, a Language Model (LM) operates in isolation, 
responding solely based on its vast pre-trained knowledge without any tools, memory, or 
interaction with the live environment. 
Its strength lies in this extensive training, allowing it to explain established concepts and plan 
how to approach solving a problem with great depth. The trade-off is a complete lack of real-
time awareness; it is functionally "blind" to any event or fact outside its training data. 
For instance, it can explain the rules of professional baseball and the complete history of the 
New York Yankees. But if you ask, "What was the final score of the Yankees game last night?", 
it would be unable to answer. That game is a specific, real-world event that happened after 
its training data was collected, so the information simply doesn't exist in its knowledge.
Level 1: The Connected Problem-Solver
At this level, the reasoning engine becomes a functional agent by connecting to and utilizing 
external tools - the "Hands" component of our architecture. Its problem-solving is no longer 
confined to its static, pre-trained knowledge.
Using the 5-step loop, the agent can now answer our previous question. Given the "Mission": 
"What was the final score of the Yankees game last night?", its "Think" step recognizes this 
as a real-time data need. Its "Act" step then invokes a tool, like a Google Search API with the 
proper date and search terms. It "Observes" the search result (e.g., "Yankees won 5-3"), and 
synthesizes that fact into a final answer.

This fundamental ability to interact with the world - whether using a search tool for a score , 
a financial API for a live stock price, or a database via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
is the core capability of a Level 1 agent.
Level 2: The Strategic Problem-Solver
Level 2 marks a significant expansion in capability, moving from executing simple tasks to 
strategically planning complex, multi-part goals. The key skill that emerges here is context 
engineering: the agent's ability to actively select, package, and manage the most relevant 
information for each step of its plan.
An agent's accuracy depends on a focused, high-quality context. Context engineering 
curates the model's limited attention to prevent overload and ensure efficient performance.
For instance, consider the "Mission": "Find a good coffee shop halfway between my office 
at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, and my client's office at 1 Market St, 
San Francisco." 
A Level 2 agent will start creating a plan:
1.	 Think: "I must first find the halfway point."
•	 Act: Call the Maps tool with both addresses.
•	 Observe: "The halfway point is Millbrae, CA."
2.	Think: "Now I must find coffee shops in Millbrae. The user asked for 'good' ones, so I will 
search for places with a 4-star rating or higher."

•	 Act: Call the google_places tool with query="coffee shop in Millbrae, CA", 
min_rating=4.0. (This is context engineering - it automatically created a new, focused 
search query from the previous step's output ).
•	 Observe: "The search returns 'Millbrae Coffee' and 'The Daily Grind'."
3.	 Think: "I will synthesize these results and present them to the user."
This strategic planning also enables proactive assistance, like an agent that reads a long 
flight confirmation email, engineers the key context (flight number, date), and acts by adding 
it to your calendar.
Level 3: The Collaborative Multi-Agent System
At the highest level, the paradigm shifts entirely. We move away from building a single, all-
powerful "super-agent" and toward a "team of specialists" working in concert, a model that 
directly mirrors a human organization. The system's collective strength lies in this division of 
labor. 
Here, agents treat other agents as tools. Imagine a "Project Manager" agent receiving a 
"Mission": "Launch our new 'Solaris' headphones."
The Project Manager agent doesn't do the entire work itself. It Acts by creating new Missions 
for its team of specialized agents much like how it works in the real life:
1.	 Delegates to MarketResearchAgent: "Analyze competitor pricing for noise-canceling 
headphones. Return a summary document by tomorrow."
2.	Delegates to MarketingAgent: "Draft three versions of a press release using the 'Solaris' 
product spec sheet as context."

3.	 Delegates to WebDevAgent: "Generate the new product page HTML based on the 
attached design mockups."
This collaborative model, while currently constrained by the reasoning limitations of today's 
LMs, represents the frontier of automating entire, complex business workflows from start 
to finish.
Level 4: The Self-Evolving System
Level 4 represents a profound leap from delegation to autonomous creation and adaptation. 
At this level, an agentic system can identify gaps in its own capabilities and dynamically 
create new tools or even new agents to fill them. It moves from using a fixed set of resources 
to actively expanding them.
Following our example, the "Project Manager" agent, tasked with the 'Solaris' launch, might 
realize it needs to monitor social media sentiment, but no such tool or agent exists on 
its team.
1.	 Think (Meta-Reasoning): "I must track social media buzz for 'Solaris,' but I lack 
the capability."
2.	Act (Autonomous Creation): Instead of failing, it invokes a high-level AgentCreator tool 
with a new mission: "Build a new agent that monitors social media for keywords 'Solaris 
headphones', performs sentiment analysis, and reports a daily summary."
3.	 Observe: A new, specialized SentimentAnalysisAgent is created, tested, and added to the 
team on the fly, ready to contribute to the original mission.
This level of autonomy, where a system can dynamically expand its own capabilities, turns a 
team of agents into a truly learning and evolving organization.
